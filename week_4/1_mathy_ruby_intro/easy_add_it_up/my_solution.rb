# U2.W4: Add it up!

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge [by myself].

# 1. Pseudocode
write a total array 


# What is the input?
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?


# 2. Initial Solution
#def total(my_array)
#var="sum"
#sum = 0
#for i in my_array
#sum += i 
#end
#puts sum
#end
#
#total([1,2,3,4])


#def sentence_maker(my_sentence)
#sentence = ""
#for i in my_sentence
#sentence += i
#sentence += " "
#end
#sentence += "."
#puts sentence
#end
#sentence_maker(["i", "want", "to", "learn", "how", "to", "code"])


# 3. Refactored Solution



# 4. Reflection
